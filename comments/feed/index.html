					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Nitrogen, phosphate and potassium are essential for healthy plant growth. Synthetic compounds combine these elements into specific and exact mixes, so a grower can get the exact amount of specific nutrients they need, as opposed to working with and mixing organic products to find the right measurements and mix.

Some organics like&#160;peat moss&#160;or&#160;coco mulch&#160;can and will also compact, which is exactly why Growers High Porosity contains perlite. [&#8230;]]]></description>
