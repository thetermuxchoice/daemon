<p>We took two organic, hand-sourced inputs: Coco Fiber and Perlite. We combined them in a 70/30 ratio to create a pH stable media with the great benefits of coco fiber and the increased aeration and drainage of perlite.</p>
<p>Our 70/30 mix is perfect for growers who want boost growth and flowering through increased aeration and nutrient retention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pith Fiber. Coir. Or just Coco.</h2>
<p>A byproduct of the coconut shell, the long fibers in the coconut are used in the textile industry throughout Asia. During its processing, short fibers fall to the ground as waste product.</p>
<h4>Luckily we hate waste.</h4>
<p>So we have those short fibers re-processed and sent over to us to develop into the perfect potting soil. Growers Organic Coco is a 100% pure, organic coco medium made for growers who want to get the most benefits possible out of high quality coco fiber.</p>
