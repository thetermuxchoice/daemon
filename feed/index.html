]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coco coir is an extremely versatile medium that <a href="https://growerssoil.com/benefits-of-growing-in-coco/">can be used on its own or in combination with other components</a> to create an incredible soil blend like Growers High porosity.</p>
<p>But getting coco coir on its own can be a tricky process. If you&#8217;re trying to make your own blend and want to save costs on the coco coir you need to do it, you could end up hurting yourself and your plants in the end by not choosing the right options.</p>
<h3>Coco Coir Bricks</h3>
<p>You have probably seen coco bricks at your local grow store, after all the packaging is pretty easy to recognize, it&#8217;s a brick. But not all coco coir bricks are created equally, and we mean that literally.</p>
<p>When shipped raw, coco bricks are highly variable, and typically never the same. There may be random EC/PH  fluctuations per brick, other bricks might need to be to processed again and you also have the task of rehydrating the coco before being able to use it.</p>
<p>With the risk of variation between bricks, buying coco coir bricks in bulk can be risky if you don&#8217;t have the proper tools to re-process them if necessary.</p>
<h3>Unbuffered Coco</h3>
<p>Unbuffered coco coir is basically coco that is natural. That doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing right? Except some the nutrients that come naturally in coco aren&#8217;t great for growing plants, and they need to be buffered before you can use it.</p>
<p>In other words, <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;unbuffered coco fiber has not been released from its high sodium, chloride, and potassium charge. High potassium charge does not mix good with other fertilizers causing lockout, &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:7039,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16777215],&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;}">unbuffered coco fiber <a href="https://growguru.co.za/blogs/hydroponic/buffering-coco-coir">has not been released from its high sodium, chloride, and potassium charge</a>. That high potassium charge does not mix good with other fertilizers which can cause lockout and other problems. </span></p>
<p>You may save a couple bucks with a bag of unbuffered coco, but the costs will come back when you need to buy the proper supplements to buffer it before use.</p>
<h3>Ground Coco</h3>
<p>The downside to commercially available coco coir is that if you don&#8217;t get in the forms already mentioned, it may come ground up. This is a standard for a lot of coco producers, but it has some downsides.</p>
<p>The main pitfall of ground coco is that the process of <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;mechanically pulverized coco decreases the oxygen and moisture hiolding capacity&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:829,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">mechanically pulverizing coco decreases the oxygen and moisture holding capacity of the medium, which needs to be accounted for with additional components to get those properties back. Growers High Porosity contains coco coir that isn&#8217;t pulverized, but gently broken down to maintain its long fibrous qualities, moisture holding capacity and oxygen content.</span></p>
<p>In addition to this process, <a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/blogs/news/coco-vs-peat">we also include peat and perlite to complete the High Porosity blend</a>. This helps to aerate the soil even more while still maintaining incredible moisture holding capabilities.</p>
<p>Avoid the hassle of buying coco coir from an untrustworthy dealer across the ocean, having to buffer your own coco or break down the bricks, and <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">grab a bag of Growers High Porosity instead</a>.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Before hydroponics it was essential for growing big, healthy plants.</h4>
<p>If it isn’t taken care of properly, it can ruin a harvest. We all know how important soil is for plants, but what is soil?</p>

<h3>What is soil?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USDA</a> defines soil as, “a natural body comprised of solids (minerals and organic matter), liquid, and gases that occurs on the land surface,” but the soil you get at Cultivate is much more complex than some dirt from the ground.</p>
<p>Different soil brands will experiment with new ingredients, like adding bat guano or ground up seashell. Others combine various mediums together. Peat, coco, perlite and more combine to create a blended soil product <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">like Growers High Porosity</a>, with characteristics from each ingredient.</p>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<h3>Peat</h3>
<p>The result of millions of years of decomposition, <a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/blogs/news/peat-moss-from-bogs-to-bags?_pos=1&amp;_sid=60dfc1bc0&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peat moss</a>, more commonly just called peat, is a moss that develops in bogs in the northern hemisphere. Canada is one of the top producers of peat moss, having one of the largest conglomerations of peat bogs in the world.</p>
<p>Peat is used in soil mixes mainly for its ability to hold water and nutrients for a very long time. Due to the nature of its composition, peat decomposes very slowly over time, making it very cost-effective for cultivators. However, peat moss is not a renewable material. It takes centuries to develop, making some growers hesitant to support the practice.</p>
<h3>Perlite</h3>
<p>Perlite is known for its great aeration qualities. A man-made product, <a href="https://www.maximumyield.com/definition/4568/perlite">perlite is created through superheating volcanic glass</a> to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit (871 Celsius), popping the glass and expanding it to over 10x its original size. This process makes a very lightweight product that looks like popcorn.</p>
<p>Very porous and lightweight, perlite allows water to drain more quickly from your plants. Perlite is great for plants that don’t mind less moisture in the soil, or plants that do well in soil that drains faster than other mediums.</p>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>Coco is the byproduct of the coconut industry and a renewable resource with minimal ecological impact. It comes from the husks of coconuts either decomposed or ground up that are left over from processing the rest of the coconut. <a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/blogs/news/coco-vs-peat?_pos=1&amp;_sid=e7969e9e9&amp;_ss=r">The end product is similar to peat in look and structure</a>, but operates differently.</p>
<p>Unable to hold as much water and nutrients as peat, coco provides better aeration for plants. Growers can then feed plants more often which can help them grow more robust. Coco is also high in sodium and potassium.</p>
<h3>Organic Ingredients</h3>
<p>Other additives aren’t necessarily mediums themselves, but are regularly added to soils for their beneficial, organic properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/products/super-bat-budswel-1-gal?_pos=2&amp;_sid=3f98e1167&amp;_ss=r">Bat guano</a> is added for its readily available nitrogen, phosphorus and other micronutrients. Kelp meal is dried and milled seaweed that contains a rich amount of Potash, making it an ideal supplement for all plants.</p>
<p>One of the most common (and naturally occurring) organic supplements for soil is earth worm castings. Worm castings contain a healthy dose of nitrogen that is slowly released into your plants over time. Additionally, earth worm castings carry many other beneficial micronutrients and bacteria.</p>
<p>So, what is soil? It’s a lot of things! But one thing it definitely isn’t, is just dirt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;">You might have noticed a bunch of popcorn-like rocks inside a bag of Growers High Porosity. That&#8217;s perlite.</h4>
<p>What is perlite? It&#8217;s simple, really.</p>
<p>Perlite is volcanic ash that has been spewed from a volcano during an eruption. These clumps of ash fall back down to earth in chunks of volcanic glass that explode into pieces upon contact with the earth.</p>
<p>After it is mined and super heated, the glass chunks pop like popcorn, turning them into white, lightweight rocks. So <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">what purpose does perlite serve in a blend like <strong>High Porosity</strong></a>?</p>
<h3>All About Aeration</h3>
<p>Perlite is most commonly used for its aerated properties. Due to how its created, perlite is super lightweight. During the heating process to make it, tiny air pockets are created in the perlite rocks. These air pockets are great for oxygenating root zones in soil.</p>
<p>Regular soil is the easiest option to add perlite too, as it is quite heavy and can become compacted, which perlite prevents. Some organics like peat moss or coco mulch can and will also compact, which<a href="https://growerssoil.com/how-to-use-growers-high-porosity/"> is exactly why <strong>Growers High Porosity</strong> contains perlite</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I Grow in Just Perlite?</h3>
<p>The easy answer is no. Perlite has little to no nutrition of its own, which makes it very difficult if not impossible for a plants to thrive in perlite alone.</p>
<p>For this reason, perlite is best used as an addition to your soil blend. But if you want to skip all the fuss of mixing your own blend but still want the benefits of perlite in an awesome medium, Growers has you covered. The <strong>High Porosity</strong> blend contains the perfect mix of peat, coco and perlite for an aerated mix that still holds the perfect amount of moisture.</p>
<p><a href="https://growerssoil.com/find-us/">See where you can pick up a bag or pallet of Growers here.</a></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The industrial revolution paved the way for agricultural methods that made production faster in ways that had previously not been possible. Conventional farming methods were accelerated using fossil fuels, and alluvial lands were discovered and used to set up spaces for growing crops at maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Industrial agriculture kept on innovating and creating new economic possibilities, with biological research leading to great discoveries in crop genetics. These discoveries led to the creation of disease-resistant crop breeds that would later maximize yields and feed more people.</p>
<p>Due to the world’s dependence on soil, over-farming agricultural lands over the years has led to rising fertilizer usage and the need to protect plants from weeds, pests and other elements during farming.</p>
<p>The challenges facing soil-based agriculture have <a href="https://growerssoil.com/why-you-should-consider-growing-soilless/">led to the invention of soilless growing</a>, a.k.a. hydroponics, a method of growing crops without the use of soil. In soilless agriculture, crops are grown in nutrient solutions. This is a popular way to grow plants indoors that reduces the risk of crops being exposed to pests and harsh weather conditions.</p>
<h2>Soilless Growing</h2>
<p>Soilless agriculture is a method of growing crops in mineral solutions packed with nutrients. The composition of mineral solutions depends on the crop under cultivation. Ideally, mineral solutions contain essential cations and anions, namely magnesium, calcium, potassium, sulfates and nitrates.</p>
<p>Soilless growing methods include aeroponics and continuous flow solutions, or <a href="https://growerssoil.com/benefits-of-growing-in-coco/">with mediums like coco coir</a>, peat, or rockwool.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of soilless growing is that unlike soil-based agriculture, where farmers have to use fertilizers to increase crop yield and spray pesticides to keep weeds and pests away, crops grown in a soilless medium are more protected from pests and weeds. But the biggest benefit of soilless growing is the yields.</p>
<p>Yields from soilless cultivation are significantly higher as a result of intensive practices and the possibilities of continuous, year-round production. But plants grown in a soilless medium may be prone to pathogen attacks as a result of high moisture levels, plus more susceptible to rapid death as a result of their lower buffering capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Soil-based Growing</h2>
<p>Plants grown in soil will be usually be grown either in containers or out in the field. Containers like fabric pots are used for growing plants that will most likely need to be moved at some point. Field cultivation involves the preparation of land and putting in some work, like preparing your beds and conditioning them with fertilizer.</p>
<p>In soil-based agriculture, different types of soils are used to grow different crops. For instance, root crops grow better in fine soils because such soils allow for better root growth.</p>
<p>Realistically, the best setting for growing in a soil-based medium is outdoors. Soilless growing conserves water, it conserves land,  and requires less pesticides that increase a farm&#8217;s risk of runoff. In a world where growing in indoor environments has become the standard for producing quality plants, soilless growing is almost always the best choice.</p>

<p>It’s easy to just grab a bag of potting soil from your local grow shop and plant your cannabis plants in it. You’ll get results, they just might not be the results you were expecting.</p>
<p>The reality is, to grow better cannabis you need to be smarter about how you’re growing it. From the nutrients you use, to when you top your plants, to when you chop them down are all important factors. But a simple change you can make in your grow to boost your yields and quality is to just swap out your medium.</p>
<p>And there’s no better medium to add to your blend or as a standalone home for your plants than coco coir. Here’s the top 4 reasons you need to be using it in your grow.</p>

<h3>Coco is Renewable</h3>
<p>Coco coir is a byproduct. If it wasn’t for some genius discovering how great cannabis grew in it, that’s what it would have stayed. When coconuts are used for their husks and meat, in food to textiles mainly across Asia, coco coir is the loose stringy material that falls off during processing.</p>
<p>Instead of just throwing this byproduct out, <a href="https://growerssoil.com/how-to-use-growers-high-porosity/">it is recycled and batched into bags</a>, then shipped across the world. Compared to other mediums that take hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years to collect its beneficial microorganisms and other decayed biological material, coconuts take much less time to mature.</p>
<p>The main source of coco coir comes from the Malaysian coconut tree, which has spread across most coasts around the world, making it the most available worldwide. After reaching full growth in 5-6 years, the coconut tree will continually produce coconuts for several more years.</p>
<p>While six years might seem like a long time to wait for some coconuts, it’s <a href="https://growerssoil.com/coco-vs-peat/">much faster than waiting for a peat bog to develop</a>, and it’s much more environmentally friendly than mining for perlite and other media, considering just one coconut tree can produce over 150 coconuts in its lifetime.</p>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<h3>Coco is pH Neutral</h3>
<p>pH can be subtle, and also detrimental if ignored. Potting soils, peat and other organic media will either have a more basic or acidic pH based on what it contains. Because cannabis requires a specific pH acidity to grow, this has to be accounted for when you decide to use an organic medium and additional nutrients.</p>
<p>While it isn’t difficult to change you pH with some additives, you can avoid the hassle altogether by growing in coco. As a pH neutral medium, you <a href="https://www.maximumyield.com/crazy-for-coco-coir/2/1237">have much more control</a> over your plant’s environment. It is also easier to manage your feedings without having to account for rapid pH changes that could shock your plants.</p>
<h3>It’s Great for Holding Moisture</h3>
<p>Because of coco’s lightweight but still-absorbent nature, it can hold water extremely well while still maintaining its great aeration and drainage abilities. If you want to feed your plants more often while still ensuring your plants are getting as much as possible without overfeeding, coco is a great option.</p>
<p>When combined with other additional media like peat and perlite, you can create a high aerated blend that can still hold moisture. Or simply add coco into whatever soil blend you are using now to add some extra aeration, plus the final benefits of coco; its nutrient content.</p>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<h3>Full of Nutrients</h3>
<p>Think of a coconut like a giant seed. The way coconuts spread across the globe was by falling off of their tress and rolling into the ocean. After landing on a foreign beach the coconuts would shed their outer material through the journey and eventually result in the sprouting of a new tree.</p>
<p>The same organic, nutrient rich material that the coconut produces to sprout new trees is also in coco coir. By adding coco coir to your soil mix you get additional nutrients rich in hormones and bio-stimulants that encourage more growth. Compared to peat which is also full of nutrients, other than the obvious renewability benefits of coco, it also much stronger of a material. In fact, coco coir resists compacting and breakage to the point that it can last three-times longer than peat.</p>
<p>With a slew of benefits and very few cons, growing in coco or even just adding some to your current soil blend can make a world of difference. <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">It&#8217;s also why we use coco in our High Porosity blend</a>. In combination with peat and perlite, the Growers High Porosity blend holds moisture while still keeping the great aeration properties of coco and perlite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growers <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">High Porosity soil blend</a> has a unique mix of coco, peat and perlite that makes for an excellent medium. However with its unique features comes a little bit of learning.</p>
<p>Compared to other media out there, we have some guidelines for maximizing your plants&#8217; potential when you plant it in some High Porosity.</p>
<h3>How to use Growers High Porosity</h3>
<p>High Porosity (HP) holds more water in the first week of vegetative growth compared to other media. This requires slightly less watering.</p>
<p>With that in mind, transplant your rooted cutting into a 3-4 inch pot. We recommend smaller pots because they allow great root development before your secondary transplant.</p>
<p>Hand water the first day, the third day and the fifth day, being sure to maintain proper room humidity and temperature. After the fifth day, you begin using flood and drain or drip irrigation for proper watering.</p>
<p>After roots have shown in the bottom of the pot, continue your plants&#8217; vegetative growth until they are 8 to 12 inches tall, at which point they should be fully root bound and ready to transplant into your next size container.</p>
<h3>Transplanting into High Porosity</h3>
<p>For 1-4 ounce plants, 3 gallon containers are the most appropriate. Transplant your 3-4 inch pot into a 3-gallon pot and use the same watering strategy as earlier. First day, third day, fifth day and additionally the seventh day.</p>
<p>After the seventh day roots should be coming out of the bottom. Continue to water every other day from this point until the plant is fully rooted in your pot. You may then water them once a day with drip irrigation, flood and drain, or by hand should you choose.</p>
<p>For 4-28 ounce plants, a 7-gallon pot is ideal. When using 7 gallon pots, we like to start with 4 inch pots over 3 inch pots. Grow the plants out until they are about 12 inches tall and then transplant directly into the 7-gallon. ( The same technique is also used for 10 and 15 and 20 gallon pots.)</p>
<p>Veg your plant to standard height.  Depending on your variety, this can be anywhere between 18 and 48 inches. Then initiate flower.</p>
<p><strong>Note: If you have to use flood and drain from the beginning, do this:</strong></p>
<p>Pre-wet your soil. One way to do this is to pot your 3 and 4 inch pots and flood it halfway, then let it drain.</p>
<p>The preferred method is top feed watering with a standard water wand. Transplant your plants, then flood again halfway in three days. As soon as roots are coming out of the bottom of the pot you can set an automated watering schedule for once every day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Growing in a soilless media has its benefits. But it isn't without its cons either.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://growerssoil.com/why-you-should-consider-growing-soilless/">Why You Should Consider Growing Soilless</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://growerssoil.com">Growers Soil</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>All media is not the same. With the fast rise of hydroponic grow systems and precision growing methods, soilless mediums are becoming more prevalent and popular.</h4>
<p>Hydroponic systems require a consistent flow of water through your plants. <a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/what-is-soil-cultivate-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soil-based mediums hold water longer</a> than soilless mediums, which makes it difficult to have a consistent ebb and flow of water through your plants, as water hangs around longer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few reasons why you should consider growing in a soilless medium on your next run.</p>
<h3>Better Drainage</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re growing with hydroponics, <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">drainage is essential</a>. Your standard fertilizers and soils are dense, and hold much more moisture. This is nice if you don&#8217;t want to feed that often.</p>
<p>However hydroponic systems are designed to feed your plants more. In a flowing hydroponic system, there is constantly water and nutrients flowing through your medium. If you&#8217;re using plain soil, this will inevitably result in overfeeding because the soil will hold onto moisture too long.</p>
<p>With soilless mediums, you get more porosity which allows your plants to drain faster, allowing you to feed them more, without the worry of overfeeding or overflowing your plants with water.</p>
<h3>Precise Nutrient Control</h3>
<p>Fertilizers and soils naturally have nutrients in them already. When using these types of mediums you need to account for the nutrients already in there before you throw in the recommended nutrient dose.</p>
<p>Soilless mediums <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/100-coco/">like coco and rockwool</a> are inert mediums, and have no natural nutrient content. This lets you be much more precise with your nutrient measurements, instead of having to account for what&#8217;s already in your media.</p>
<h3>Less Bugs</h3>
<p>A big problem for growers who use soil-based mediums is the bugs. Considering soil, otherwise known as <em>dirt</em>, is where most bugs live, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they would try to find a home in your soil.</p>
<p>With a soilless medium you are a lot less likely to encounter a bug problem in your grow. We all know that once a bug problem starts, it&#8217;s a pain to deal with, and sometimes results in the loss of plants. The likeliness of something similar happening with a soilless medium is so slim that there really isn&#8217;t any debate on which is better for preventing pests.</p>
<h3>Is Soilless For You?</h3>
<p>A lot of people are comfortable growing in soil. It definitely has it&#8217;s benefits, and for new growers, it&#8217;s a great starting point. But for the hydroponic grower out there, soil usually isn&#8217;t an option.</p>
<p>But even if you don&#8217;t have a full hydroponic system set up, you can still use a soilless medium to your advantage in the grow.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Coco coir is renewable, reusable and just generally a great medium. But why?</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://growerssoil.com/what-is-coco-coir/">What Is Coco Coir?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://growerssoil.com">Growers Soil</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>It&#8217;s not the kind of coco you add hot water to and drink. It&#8217;s the kind of coco you put your plants in for awesome results.</h4>
<p>Coco coir is a highly absorbent medium, and one of the few mediums that is renewable. It&#8217;s also part of Growers&#8217; <a href="https://growerssoil.com/products/high-porosity/">High Porosity blend</a>.</p>
<p>What makes coco coir so special is how it&#8217;s obtained, it&#8217;s neutral pH and the many benefits it can provide for your soil (or soilless) blend.</p>
<h2>Coco Coir Origins</h2>
<p>Coco coir is actually a byproduct of the coconut fiber industry. Between the outer husk and the actual coconut is a layer of fibrous threads. While the outer husk and coconut may be used for textiles and other coconut products, the coco coir is usually set aside.</p>
<p>This leftover byproduct is then compacted into bricks or sold loosely for use in agriculture. Compared to its more controversial counterpart peat, coco coir is completely renewable, and is viewed as the more sustainable medium.</p>
<p>Most coco coir is derived from Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. Growers single sources our coco in dehydrated bricks to prevent any contamination or mold. We&#8217;ve had the same relationship with our source for over 20 years.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Coco Coir</h2>
<p>One of the main benefits of coco is its unique water holding properties. Coco has a high water holding capacity, but it is also more aerated than other mediums like peat.</p>
<p>Due to this, you can feed your plants more often, and get bigger plants using coco-based mediums.</p>
<h2>Downsides of Coco Coir</h2>
<p>There aren&#8217;t too many negatives to growing in coco, but a common issue with coco is how it is sourced. A large majority of coco coir is sourced from Asia, and chemicals are sometimes used in the packing and storage process.</p>
<p>Luckily, Growers has had the same coco coir source for over 15 years. We get the most premium, dehydrated coco available on the market, which then goes into our High Porosity and 100% Coco Blends.</p>
<p>Coco is a unique medium. It&#8217;s light, but holds water, but not too long. In a way, it&#8217;s the perfect medium. On it&#8217;s own, or in a soil blend like High Porosity, coco is a versatile medium that you should give a try if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<p>If it’s your first time growing, you might just plant a seed in the ground and start watering it. While this <em>can </em>work, knowing how to germinate seeds can make a big difference.</p>
<h3>What is Germination?</h3>
<p>Simply put, germination is when a seed is exposed to moisture enough that it will crack, exposing its root that is seeking that moisture. Opposed to planting seeds straight into soil before they are cracked, germinating your seeds can speed up the process in which your plants begin their initial stages of growth.</p>
<p>With the root already exposed, the plant will grow into the soil faster and more efficiently. Plus, knowing how to germinate seeds can help you determine the viability of your seeds before you plant them. If you germinate a seed and it doesn’t crack, then you don’t waste the time of planting it only to find out later on that it’s unviable.</p>

<h3>How to Germinate Seeds</h3>
<p>When it comes to how to germinate seeds, environment is the first factor to get out of the way. You need moisture, in a warm and dark environment.</p>
<p>The most popular and easiest technique of germination is the paper towel method. In case you didn’t guess, it involves nothing more than a paper towel and the optional holding container.</p>
<p>To start the germination process, you’ll want to wet the paper towel. Not dripping wet, but to the point that the whole towel is wet while staying strong. Place the paper towel down on a flat surface and put your seed into the center of the paper towel.</p>
<p>You’ll then want to fold the paper towel over the seeds so they are completely covered. Now you can put the paper towel with the seeds wrapped within into a holding container if you’d like. Be careful with containers though, as a tight seal with no air flow can become a breeding ground for mold.</p>
<p>After you have the seeds wrapped up and in the container (or not), put them in a dark, warm place. A closet near a heating vent, under the bed, wherever there is little light while still staying warm, between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<h3>Germinating Seeds Successfully</h3>
<p>Another option for germinating seeds is using rockwool. This is much more popular for large scale growing, as you can plant hundreds of seeds into small blocks of rockwool and treat it similarly to the paper towel method.</p>
<p>Just keep the rockwool blocks wet with pH balanced water. With rockwool, you don’t have to transition your seedlings from a paper towel to the next medium. You can let your plants progress through early stages of vegetation before needing to transplant them to soil or whichever medium you are using.</p>
<p>A successful <a href="https://cultivatecolorado.com/rockwool-vs-aerocloner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">germination in rockwool</a> is obvious, since you will see the growth. With the paper towel method, you need to see the taproot popping out from the shell of the seed within a day or so. You can still plant seeds that have not cracked at this point into the medium you use with the successful seeds. They might just be delayed in their growth, or they won’t sprout.</p>
<p>Getting your plants started is easy once you know how to germinate seeds. Whether you are on a budget and want to use a paper towel or have a bunch of seeds you want to pop, the main thing is to be observant. Keep an eye on your seeds and make sure they’re hydrated.</p>
<p>Before you know it, it will be time to transplant!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrient lockout is one of the most common issues that a grower can face. Especially for new growers who don’t know what nutrient lockout is yet, this issue can destroy a grow before it has a chance to grow big and strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrient lockout is pretty simple. When a plant experiences nutrient lockout, it becomes no longer able to intake the nutrients that it is being fed. The nutrients are literally being locked out of the plant.</span></p>
<h3>What Causes Lockout?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This problem usually occurs as a result of a chemical reaction between the growing media, nutrient solution and the plants themselves. When your plant continuously absorbs nutrients and water, over time your growing medium can accumulated excess salts and other substances from nutrients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there is too much buildup in your medium, it can react with your plants and the nutrients you are feeding them. When this happens, excess nutrients can clump together or become ineffective, making them unavailable to the plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, too much nutrient build-up causes a change in the pH of your grow environment, causing a nutrient lockout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common signs of nutrient lockout include stunted growth and yellowing leaves, as well as leaf burn. Plants can also become limp and lifeless over time. It can even start to look like your plants are underfed, but remember feeding plants more that are suffering from nutrient lockout won’t help them take in any more nutrients, and may make the problem worse.</span></p>
<h3>Fixing Nutrient Lockout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to nutrient burn, the best way to take care of nutrient lockout is to flush your plants. By clearing out your growing medium you rinse out the built-up salts that are causing the lockout. You can use plain, fresh water to flush your medium without any nutrients until the blockage clears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to actively avoid nutrient lockout is to monitor your pH. Using Reverse Osmosis water can make it easier to adjust and maintain pH because RO water will give you more control over the pH of your water. Also, there are pH base nutrients that get your plant into the prime pH sweet spot, with less need for constant measurements of pH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all comes down to pH, grow environment, nutrients and the water you use. Even if you do everything perfectly, things can still go wrong and nutrient lockout can still happen. Just remember to flush completely with pure water, and monitor your plants closely until they can start accepting nutrients again.</span></p>
