Products from fertilizers to nutrients to additives, all with the claim of providing the best. It can get confusing when you see a four bottles of nutrients, but two are A&amp;B nutrients and 2 are two-part nutrients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first differences between these two nutrients is the separation and quantity of specific nutrients. Every nutrient (except a select few) has a specific NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) ratio. Plants in different growth phases can require or benefit from higher or lower levels of specific elements, and these nutrient products aim to find the perfect ratio for your grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>A&amp;B Nutrients<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A&amp;B nutrients are split into two separate containers, each containing specific nutrients and amounts of the NPK ratio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plants require specific macro and micro-nutrients in order to thrive much like humans. In A&amp;B nutrients, the A bottle may have Nitrogen and several micronutrients. The B bottle will have phosphorus and potassium with the remaining micronutrients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>1, 2 and 3 Part Nutrients<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One to three part nutrient products will have nutrients split up depending on how much a grower wants to be involved. A one part product will have a slurry of every single nutrient in one bottle. All it needs a good shake before use to deliver all the nutrients your plant needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A two part nutrient is nearly identical to an A&amp;B product, as it is two separate containers that hold the amounts of NPK and other nutrients that, when combined, create a full product. They are only separated to avoid chemical interactions between elements and nutrients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three part nutrient is like a two part nutrient split into three containers, so instead of more concentrated quantities in two or one bottle, you have less concentrated product in three containers. Each nutrient bottle can be utilized separately during a phase of growth (e.g veg and flower) or combined throughout the entire growth process to develop the right mix. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, the micronutrient bottle will be used throughout the whole process, while the veg nutrient will only be used at the beginning, and the bloom nutrient at the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These nutrients allow a grower to experiment with their measurements to see what works best for their grow. However, there is a higher risk of messing up measurements when you have to individually measure and combine three separate products.
