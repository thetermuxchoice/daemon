Outdoor, greenhouse, and indoor growing methods are three very different options with great differences in set-up costs, management responsibilities, and end results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since outdoor is only an option in areas with proper climate and weather patterns, greenhouse and indoor grows have become overwhelmingly popular. This does not mean one option is definitively better than the other, as each has their own unique pros and cons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to growing indoors, cost is usually the biggest factor. Considering initial start-up costs of designing and building a facility, in addition to all of the regulatory equipment and codes that must be met in order to operate legally, indoor is not for anybody trying to save money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If cost is no issue, indoor can be an extremely effective growing method. Being able to control every aspect of the grow from temperature and humidity to watering systems (whether hydroponic or aeroponic) and light cycles puts the grower in full control of their plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Light Deprivation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not as controlled as an indoor grow, light deprivation in a greenhouse can work just as well, and with just as qualitative results. Instead of having a bunch of lights on a schedule to keep plants in a vegetative state or to push them faster in flower, a greenhouse will use the sun as the primary light source. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a light deprivation shade that can either be manually pulled or put on a timer, light can be blocked during the day, while still maintaining a more natural environment for the plants to thrive. This allows growers to produce hearty, high quality plants for a much lower price over time than an indoor setup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although light deprivation in a greenhouse setting might seem like the obvious choice, indoor grows will almost always have higher yields with a more potent end product that will look better to the consumer. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you live in a great climate for outdoor growing, this is by far the cheapest option. However, you are at the mercy of mother nature. If it storms hard your plants can be destroyed without the extra protection of a greenhouse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However a grower can also see great results from an outdoor setup. In places like the Emerald Triangle in California, and areas of Oregon and Washington state, the climate is perfect for outdoor horticulture. A seed that is planted in one of these regions will almost always grow successfully. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you grow in a greenhouse right now and are looking
