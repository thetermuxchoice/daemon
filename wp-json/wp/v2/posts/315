While this\u00a0<em>can\u00a0<\/em>work, knowing how to germinate seeds can make a big difference.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Germination?<\/h3>\n<p>Simply put, germination is when a seed is exposed to moisture enough that it will crack, exposing its root that is seeking that moisture. Opposed to planting seeds straight into soil before they are cracked, germinating your seeds can speed up the process in which your plants begin their initial stages of growth.<\/p>\n<p>With the root already exposed, the plant will grow into the soil faster and more efficiently. Plus, knowing how to germinate seeds can help you determine the viability of your seeds before you plant them. If you germinate a seed and it doesn\u2019t crack, then you don\u2019t waste the time of planting it only to find out later on that it\u2019s unviable.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-317 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/seedlings-3-879x675-e1549659982657.jpg\" alt=\"how to germinate seeds\" width=\"400\" height=\"307\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_3\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h3>How to Germinate Seeds<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to how to germinate seeds, environment is the first factor to get out of the way. You need moisture, in a warm and dark environment.<\/p>\n<p>The most popular and easiest technique of germination is the paper towel method. In case you didn\u2019t guess, it involves nothing more than a paper towel and the optional holding container.<\/p>\n<p>To start the germination process, you\u2019ll want to wet the paper towel. Not dripping wet, but to the point that the whole towel is wet while staying strong. Place the paper towel down on a flat surface and put your seed into the center of the paper towel.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then want to fold the paper towel over the seeds so they are completely covered. Now you can put the paper towel with the seeds wrapped within into a holding container if you\u2019d like. Be careful with containers though, as a tight seal with no air flow can become a breeding ground for mold.<\/p>\n<p>After you have the seeds wrapped up and in the container (or not), put them in a dark, warm place. A closet near a heating vent, under the bed, wherever there is little light while still staying warm, between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_4\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_4 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h3>Germinating Seeds Successfully<\/h3>\n<p>Another option for germinating seeds is using rockwool. This is much more popular for large scale growing, as you can plant hundreds of seeds into small blocks of rockwool and treat it similarly to the paper towel method.<\/p>\n<p>Just keep the rockwool blocks wet with pH balanced water. With rockwool, you don\u2019t have to transition your seedlings from a paper towel to the next medium. You can let your plants progress through early stages of vegetation before needing to transplant them to soil or whichever medium you are using.<\/p>\n<p>A successful\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cultivatecolorado.com\/rockwool-vs-aerocloner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">germination in rockwool<\/a>\u00a0is obvious, since you will see the growth. With the paper towel method, you need to see the taproot popping out from the shell of the seed within a day or so. You can still plant seeds that have not cracked at this point into the medium you use with the successful seeds. They might just be delayed in their growth, or they won\u2019t sprout.<\/p>\n<p>Getting your plants started is easy once you know how to germinate seeds. Whether you are on a budget and want to use a paper towel or have a bunch of seeds you want to pop, the main thing is to be observant. Keep an eye on your seeds and make sure they\u2019re hydrated.<\/p>\n<p>Before you know it, it will be time to transplant!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You&#8217;ve decided that you want to grow from seed instead of clone.
