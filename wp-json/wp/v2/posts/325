It&#8217;s the kind of coco you put your plants in for awesome results.<\/h4>\n<p>Coco coir is a highly absorbent medium, and one of the few mediums that is renewable. It&#8217;s also part of Growers&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/products\/high-porosity\/\">High Porosity blend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What makes coco coir so special is how it&#8217;s obtained, it&#8217;s neutral pH and the many benefits it can provide for your soil (or soilless) blend.<\/p>\n<h2>Coco Coir Origins<\/h2>\n<p>Coco coir is actually a byproduct of the coconut fiber industry. Between the outer husk and the actual coconut is a layer of fibrous threads. While the outer husk and coconut may be used for textiles and other coconut products, the coco coir is usually set aside.<\/p>\n<p>This leftover byproduct is then compacted into bricks or sold loosely for use in agriculture. Compared to its more controversial counterpart peat, coco coir is completely renewable, and is viewed as the more sustainable medium.<\/p>\n<p>Most coco coir is derived from Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. Growers single sources our coco in dehydrated bricks to prevent any contamination or mold. We&#8217;ve had the same relationship with our source for over 20 years.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Coco Coir<\/h2>\n<p>One of the main benefits of coco is its unique water holding properties. Coco has a high water holding capacity, but it is also more aerated than other mediums like peat.<\/p>\n<p>Due to this, you can feed your plants more often, and get bigger plants using coco-based mediums.<\/p>\n<h2>Downsides of Coco Coir<\/h2>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t too many negatives to growing in coco, but a common issue with coco is how it is sourced. A large majority of coco coir is sourced from Asia, and chemicals are sometimes used in the packing and storage process.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Growers has had the same coco coir source for over 15 years. We get the most premium, dehydrated coco available on the market, which then goes into our High Porosity and 100% Coco Blends.<\/p>\n<p>Coco is a unique medium. It&#8217;s light, but holds water, but not too long. In a way, it&#8217;s the perfect medium. On it&#8217;s own, or in a soil blend like High Porosity, coco is a versatile medium that you should give a try if you haven&#8217;t already.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coco coir is renewable, reusable and just generally a great medium.
