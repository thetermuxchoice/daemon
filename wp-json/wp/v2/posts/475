If you&#8217;re trying to make your own blend and want to save costs on the coco coir you need to do it, you could end up hurting yourself and your plants in the end by not choosing the right options.<\/p>\n<h3>Coco Coir Bricks<\/h3>\n<p>You have probably seen coco bricks at your local grow store, after all the packaging is pretty easy to recognize, it&#8217;s a brick. But not all coco coir bricks are created equally, and we mean that literally.<\/p>\n<p>When shipped raw, coco bricks are highly variable, and typically never the same. There may be random EC\/PH\u00a0 fluctuations per brick, other bricks might need to be to processed again and you also have the task of rehydrating the coco before being able to use it.<\/p>\n<p>With the risk of variation between bricks, buying coco coir bricks in bulk can be risky if you don&#8217;t have the proper tools to re-process them if necessary.<\/p>\n<h3>Unbuffered Coco<\/h3>\n<p>Unbuffered coco coir is basically coco that is natural. That doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing right? Except some the nutrients that come naturally in coco aren&#8217;t great for growing plants, and they need to be buffered before you can use it.<\/p>\n<p>In other words,\u00a0<span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;unbuffered coco fiber has not been released from its high sodium, chloride, and potassium charge.

This is a standard for a lot of coco producers, but it has some downsides.<\/p>\n<p>The main pitfall of ground coco is that the process of\u00a0<span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;mechanically pulverized coco decreases the oxygen and moisture hiolding capacity&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:829,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:[null,2,0]},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\">mechanically pulverizing coco decreases the oxygen and moisture holding capacity of the medium, which needs to be accounted for with additional components to get those properties back. Growers High Porosity contains coco coir that isn&#8217;t pulverized, but gently broken down to maintain its long fibrous qualities, moisture holding capacity and oxygen content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition to this process, <a href=\"https:\/\/cultivatecolorado.com\/blogs\/news\/coco-vs-peat\">we also include peat and perlite to complete the High Porosity blend<\/a>. This helps to aerate the soil even more while still maintaining incredible moisture holding capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid the hassle of buying coco coir from an untrustworthy dealer across the ocean, having to buffer your own coco or break down the bricks, and <a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/products\/high-porosity\/\">grab a bag of Growers High Porosity instead<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not all coco is created
