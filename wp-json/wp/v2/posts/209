The main cause of this problem sprouts from overfeeding your plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn\u2019t sound crazy to think if your plant really likes a certain nutrient, giving it extra amounts of that nutrient would make your plant grow through the ceiling! Unfortunately, this is not what happens, and overfeeding your plants can lead to them being burned.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What is a Nutrient &#8220;Burn&#8221;?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now we know that overfeeding can cause burns, but what exactly are burns? One of the major compounds found in plant nutrients is Nitrogen, which is used predominantly during the vegetative stages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overuse of nitrogen from nutrients can result in nitrogen toxicity, which if not treated in a timely manner can lead to more severe symptoms. Early indications of nutrient build-up prior to burning becoming a serious issue include:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep green leaves<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bright green leaf tips<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stalks and branches show deep red or purple color<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yellow, burnt tips on leaves<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaf tips bending 90 degrees<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that it isn\u2019t just nitrogen that can cause plant burn if overused. After vegetative stages, your plants will want more calcium and magnesium, and overfeeding these nutrients can cause similar issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How to Fix Nutrient Burn<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest way to take care of nutrient burn is to get rid of any damaged or burned leaves. To be extra safe, follow the calyx clusters back to their branch and remove the entire impacted flower. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next thing you want to do is flush your growing medium with clean, pH balanced water. If using a reservoir, measure your contents with a pH meter and adjust with new, fresh water. Shoot for a gallon of water per gallon of media until you flush all fertilizer from the pot. Then use just water and maybe an organic tea solution for about a week, easing back into nutrients if the plant is starting to accept it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutrient can be a serious problem and if not taken care of in the early stages, it can destroy an entire crop. The best way to stop nutrient burn is to prevent it from happening in the first place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always use the right nutrients for your growth stage, and even start with using only \u00be of the recommended dosage on nutrient packaging. This gives a little more room for error if you put in a little too much solution. Always take exact measurements, and use a measuring device with a set capacity to limit chance of human error. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutrient burn can be scary and detrimental if not dealt with or prevented. Just remember that it pays to be cautious, and you will be the one paying if you\u2019re not. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No your plants aren&#8217;t burning, they&#8217;re just hurting.
