Growing indoors is typically the most expensive due to the actual building costs, costs of electricity and resources, and the task of replicating and managing every environmental factor for the best results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor growing is the cheapest option, as all a grower needs is fertile land, a good water supply, and the right nutrients and tools to take care of the plants. Sunlight is free, eliminating electricity costs, but outdoor growers also run the risk of an unpredictable environment. Freezing temperatures can kill a plant over night, and while less susceptible to disease, outdoor plants can still attract natural predators and bugs that must be handled properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The middle-ground option comes in the form of a greenhouse. A combination of indoor and outdoor growing, the cost of setting up a greenhouse is much cheaper than an indoor facility, and with some additional HVAC systems or extra lights for a cloudy day it can be a very enticing option for a grower that doesn\u2019t want as much risk from outdoor, but can\u2019t spare the money for a full indoor facility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If torn between which option to choose, one of the main considerations is money. Considering the two cheaper options, outdoor and greenhouse, it comes down to figuring out which one will be the most cost effective while still yielding the results you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are three things about greenhouse growing and outdoor growing that separate the two methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Greenhouse<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Outdoor<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Middle-Ground between Indoor and Outdoor<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheapest growing method and more vigorous plants<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can control some environmental factors in greenhouse<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More open to environmental influences like temperature and natural predators<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage sunlight with light deprivation<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Least amount of maintenance and oversight needed<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether a grower decides to go with an outdoor grow, greenhouse or indoor, the decision is based on multiple factors.
