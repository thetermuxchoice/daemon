You\u2019ll get results, they just might not be the results you were expecting.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is, to grow better cannabis you need to be smarter about how you\u2019re growing it. From the nutrients you use, to when you top your plants, to when you chop them down are all important factors. But a simple change you can make in your grow to boost your yields and quality is to just swap out your medium.<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s no better medium to add to your blend or as a standalone home for your plants than coco coir. Here\u2019s the top 4 reasons you need to be using it in your grow.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_2\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h3>Coco is Renewable<\/h3>\n<p>Coco coir is a byproduct. If it wasn\u2019t for some genius discovering how great cannabis grew in it, that\u2019s what it would have stayed. When coconuts are used for their husks and meat, in food to textiles mainly across Asia, coco coir is the loose stringy material that falls off during processing.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of just throwing this byproduct out,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/how-to-use-growers-high-porosity\/\">it is recycled and batched into bags<\/a>, then shipped across the world. Compared to other mediums that take hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years to collect its beneficial microorganisms and other decayed biological material, coconuts take much less time to mature.<\/p>\n<p>The main source of coco coir comes from the Malaysian coconut tree, which has spread across most coasts around the world, making it the most available worldwide. After reaching full growth in 5-6 years, the coconut tree will continually produce coconuts for several more years.<\/p>\n<p>While six years might seem like a long time to wait for some coconuts, it\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/coco-vs-peat\/\">much faster than waiting for a peat bog to develop<\/a>, and it\u2019s much more environmentally friendly than mining for perlite and other media, considering just one coconut tree can produce over 150 coconuts in its lifetime.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_3\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h3>Coco is pH Neutral<\/h3>\n<p>pH can be subtle, and also detrimental if ignored. Potting soils, peat and other organic media will either have a more basic or acidic pH based on what it contains. Because cannabis requires a specific pH acidity to grow, this has to be accounted for when you decide to use an organic medium and additional nutrients.<\/p>\n<p>While it isn\u2019t difficult to change you pH with some additives, you can avoid the hassle altogether by growing in coco. As a pH neutral medium, you\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maximumyield.com\/crazy-for-coco-coir\/2\/1237\">have much more control<\/a>\u00a0over your plant\u2019s environment. It is also easier to manage your feedings without having to account for rapid pH changes that could shock your plants.<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s Great for Holding Moisture<\/h3>\n<p>Because of coco\u2019s lightweight but still-absorbent nature, it can hold water extremely well while still maintaining its great aeration and drainage abilities. If you want to feed your plants more often while still ensuring your plants are getting as much as possible without overfeeding, coco is a great option.<\/p>\n<p>When combined with other additional media like peat and perlite, you can create a high aerated blend that can still hold moisture. Or simply add coco into whatever soil blend you are using now to add some extra aeration, plus the final benefits of coco; its nutrient content.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_4\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_4 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_left\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<h3>Full of Nutrients<\/h3>\n<p>Think of a coconut like a giant seed. The way coconuts spread across the globe was by falling off of their tress and rolling into the ocean. After landing on a foreign beach the coconuts would shed their outer material through the journey and eventually result in the sprouting of a new tree.<\/p>\n<p>The same organic, nutrient rich material that the coconut produces to sprout new trees is also in coco coir. By adding coco coir to your soil mix you get additional nutrients rich in hormones and bio-stimulants that encourage more growth. Compared to peat which is also full of nutrients, other than the obvious renewability benefits of coco, it also much stronger of a material. In fact, coco coir resists compacting and breakage to the point that it can last three-times longer than peat.<\/p>\n<p>With a slew of benefits and very few cons, growing in coco or even just adding some to your current soil blend can make a world of difference. <a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/products\/high-porosity\/\">It&#8217;s also why we use coco in our High Porosity blend<\/a>. In combination with peat and perlite, the Growers High Porosity blend holds moisture while still keeping the great aeration properties of coco and perlite.<\/p>\n<p>Learn <a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/what-is-coco-coir\/\">more about coco here<\/a> and find where you can <a href=\"https:\/\/growerssoil.com\/find-us\/\">pick up a bag of High Porosity here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coco coir is the medium you have been looking for.
